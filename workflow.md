## Checklist before commit

Traditional checklist:

  * Use the least possible amount of brainpower.
  * Monkey-type random assembly code until it pretends to work once. Commit.

Improved checklist:

  * Deep-work state. Forget everything. Use your entire brain for the task.
  * After finding a "random" path from A to B, look for a "geodesic" path from A to B, where the new feature is done with minimum resistance.
  * Small steps, small bricks. More library code, less app code.
  * When writing new library code, fulfill requirements:
    * Tests.
    * Additional logically related features. For example, you only needed an "insert" function, but you also add "update" and "delete" functions.
    * Apply new library code to existing code, reducing the amount of app code.

## Misc

* Unscheduled interruptions are better than scheduled appointments. When you have a planned meeting, you don't even start working until then, and afterwards you're too distracted to do anything!
* Management: **no appointments for developers**. No planned meetings or calls.
* Async work better than sync work:
  * Async means nobody will bother you in any way. When someone writes to you, they don't expect an immediate response. Respond whenever you want.
  * Previously, we switched from office work to remote work. Now it's from sync work to async work.
